# Atom Portfolio Template - Next.js Edition

Welcome to the Next.js version of the Atom portfolio template! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

This repository contains a portfolio template originally downloaded from [Tailwind Awesome](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/resources/atom). The original template was built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. I have transformed it into a Next.js application using the latest version of Next.js while preserving the original design and layout.

This repository is intended to be a starting point for developers who want a modern portfolio template with the power of Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Modern Design**: The template retains the clean and modern design of the original.
- **Responsive**: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure responsiveness and flexibility.
